# Hello, I'm Jonathan! 

I'm a software engineer primarily focused on backend development, with expertise in TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. Currently diving deeper into systems and infrastructure, and expanding my skills through practical projects and structured learning.

## Current Focus
- Building and maintaining REST APIs
- Learning Python and SQL
- Preparing to tackle Go
- Linux administration (via a stubborn Minecraft server)
- Teaching my kiddo their first programming language!

Note: While my public repositories represent only a portion of my work, I'm actively building and learning in private repositories and through [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) courses.
