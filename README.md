# Hello, I'm Jonathan! 

I'm a software engineer primarily focused on backend development and SaaS integrations and implementations, with expertise in building APIs using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. Currently diving deeper into systems and infrastructure, and expanding my skills through practical projects and structured learning.

## Current Focus
- Learning codebase for work, which includes technologies like GraphQL, Slonik, and modern React

## When I have time...
- Building projects, both personal and for non-profit
- Upskilling while looking for work by
  - Maintaining JavaScript and API development skills
  - Learning Python
  - Brushing up on SQL
  - Preparing to tackle Go, along with other backend-focused technologies
- Linux administration (*via a stubborn Minecraft server. Finally figured out the root freezing issue, uptime uninterrupted since early February 2025*)
- Teaching my kiddo his first programming language via the [Asteroids](https://github.com/JonathanCrider/asteroids) Python project

Note: While my public repositories represent only a portion of my work, I'm actively building and learning in private repositories and through [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) courses.
